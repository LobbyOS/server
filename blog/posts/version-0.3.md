Okay, we have some good news and bad news.

The good news is that Lobby 0.3 has undergone a lot of changes and heavy coding

The bad news is that you can't upgrade your existing Lobby to the new one.

### Why ?

The whole schematics of Lobby has changed. The base of Lobby has undergone drastic changes that a complete reinstallation would replace the older version.

A standard upgrade can't be relied on as there are a lot of changes in the new Lobby version
