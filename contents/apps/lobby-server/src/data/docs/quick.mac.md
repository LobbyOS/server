Install Lobby On Mac

# Mac

We haven't tested Lobby on a Mac, but if your Mac OS has a localhost server installed, then you can just extract the contents of the [Lobby Zip File](/api/lobby/download/latest) to a folder in your "www" (Web Root) directory. And then [configure Lobby](/docs/quick#configure-lobby) through a browser.
